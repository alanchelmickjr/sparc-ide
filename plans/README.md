## Project Overview

SPARC IDE is a customizable, open-source distribution of VSCode built for agentic software development. It integrates Roo Code to enable prompt-driven development, autonomous agent workflows, and AI-native collaboration.

## SPARC Methodology

The project follows the SPARC methodology:

1. **Specification**: Define detailed requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria
2. **Pseudocode**: Create implementation pseudocode and logic flow diagrams
3. **Architecture**: Design system architecture, component interactions, and data flow
4. **Refinement**: Implement iterative improvements, testing, and quality assurance
5. **Completion**: Finalize documentation, deployment, and maintenance plans

## Timeline

The project is divided into five phases corresponding to the SPARC methodology, with each phase building upon the previous one.

## Getting Started

Review each phase document in sequence to understand the complete project plan.
