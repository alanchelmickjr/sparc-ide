# SPARC IDE: The AI-Native Development Environment  
**Build your own intelligent IDE powered by Roo Code and the SPARC methodology**  

SPARC IDE is a customizable, open-source distribution of VSCode built for agentic software development. Inspired by tools like Windsurf and Cursor, it integrates Roo Code to enable prompt-driven development, autonomous agent workflows, and AI-native collaboration.

This project is designed for developers who want total control over their toolchain‚Äîwhether you're coding, testing, or deploying intelligent systems.
