### Security Principles

SPARC IDE follows these core security principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect critical assets
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components only have access to what they need
3. **Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default
4. **Transparency**: Security mechanisms are documented and visible
5. **Regular Updates**: Security features are regularly updated and improved

## API Key Management

SPARC IDE uses API keys to authenticate with AI services. Protecting these keys is critical to prevent unauthorized usage and potential financial impact.

### Secure Storage

API keys are stored securely using:

1. **OS-Level Secure Storage**:
   - **Linux**: Secret Service API / libsecret
   - **macOS**: Keychain
   - **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager

2. **Encryption**:
   - Keys are encrypted at rest
   - Encryption keys are derived from hardware identifiers
   - Different encryption for each user account

### API Key Configuration

To securely configure API keys:

1. Open Settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
2. Search for the relevant API key setting:
   - "roo-code.apiKey" for OpenRouter
   - "roo-code.anthropicApiKey" for Claude
   - "roo-code.openaiApiKey" for GPT-4
   - "roo-code.googleApiKey" for Gemini
3. Enter your API key
4. The key will be automatically stored in the secure storage

### API Key Rotation

Best practices for API key management include regular rotation:

1. Generate a new API key from the provider's website
2. Update the key in SPARC IDE settings
3. Revoke the old key from the provider's website
4. Verify the new key works correctly

### API Key Exposure Prevention

SPARC IDE includes safeguards to prevent accidental exposure of API keys:

1. **Redaction in Logs**:
   - API keys are automatically redacted in log files
   - Keys are replaced with "[REDACTED]" in error messages

2. **Clipboard Protection**:
   - Warning when copying content that might contain API keys
   - Option to automatically redact API keys in copied content

3. **Code Scanning**:
   - Automatic scanning for API keys in code
   - Warnings when API keys are detected in source files

## Extension Security

SPARC IDE includes robust extension security features to protect against malicious or vulnerable extensions.

### Extension Verification

Extensions are verified before installation:

1. **Signature Verification**:
   - Extensions must be cryptographically signed
   - Signatures are verified against trusted public keys
   - Invalid signatures prevent installation

2. **Publisher Verification**:
   - Extensions are verified against a list of trusted publishers
   - Unknown publishers require explicit approval
   - Verified publishers are indicated with a checkmark

### Extension Sandboxing

Extensions run in a restricted environment:

1. **Process Isolation**:
   - Extensions run in separate processes
   - Crashes in one extension don't affect others
   - Memory is isolated between extensions

2. **Permission Model**:
   - Extensions must declare required permissions
   - Users can review and approve permissions
   - Permissions can be revoked at any time

### Extension Content Security

Extension content is scanned for security issues:

1. **Malware Scanning**:
   - Extensions are scanned for known malware
   - Suspicious code patterns are flagged
   - Detected malware blocks installation

2. **Dangerous File Types**:
   - Executable files in extensions are restricted
   - Script files are scanned for malicious code
   - Binary files are analyzed for threats

### Managing Extension Security

To configure extension security settings:

1. Open Settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
