# SPARC IDE Test Reports

This directory contains test reports generated by the SPARC IDE test suite.

## Report Types

- **HTML Reports**: Comprehensive test reports with detailed results for each test category
- **Log Files**: Individual test logs for each test script
- **Summary Files**: Text-based summaries of test runs

## Viewing Reports

HTML reports can be viewed in any web browser. They provide a visual representation of test results, including:

- Overall test statistics (passed/failed)
- Individual test results
- Links to detailed logs
- Test summary

## Report Naming Convention

Reports follow this naming convention:

- HTML Reports: `test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html`
- Log Files: `[test_name]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- Summary Files: `test_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`

Where `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` is the timestamp when the test was run.

## Running Tests

To generate new test reports, run the test suite from the project root:

```bash
./tests/run_all_tests.sh
```

Or run individual test categories:

```bash
./tests/run-tests.sh build-scripts
./tests/run-tests.sh roo-code
./tests/run-tests.sh ui-config
./tests/run-tests.sh branding
